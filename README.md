# FaceDetection_openCv
Basic Implementation of face detection in image and video using openCv


Detecting faces using Haar cascades in OpenCV and Python.


It's a machine learning based approach where haarcascade function is used for face detection.

As haarcascade is trained with the set of inputs and OpenCV contains pre-trained classifiers for face known as Face Clasiifiers.
